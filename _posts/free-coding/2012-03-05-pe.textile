h2. Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

h3. Solution:

Let
$A=\{3n : n \in N; 3n < 1000\}$
$B=\{5n : n \in N; 5n < 1000\}$

Now we have
$A \cap B=\{15n : n \in N; 15n < 1000\}$

Inferred from the inclusionâ€“exclusion principle, we can easily have
$\sum_{s \in A \cup B} s = \sum_{a \in A} a+ \sum_{b \in B} b- \sum_{c \in A \cap B} c$
$= \frac{3}{2}(l+1)l+\frac{5}{2}(m+1)m-\frac{15}{2}(n+1)n$
$(l=\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor, m=\lfloor\frac{999}{5}\rfloor, n=\lfloor\frac{999}{15}\rfloor)$

h2. Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

h2. Problem 3

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

h2. Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

h2. Problem 5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

h3. Solution:

h2. Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
$1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385$

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
$(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025$

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
